## Improved scene editor experience

Scenes are a great way to set the mood in your home. They allow you to capture
the state of your devices at a specific moment and restore them later with,
for example, a button on your dashboard, using an automation, or even
using a voice command.

One of the common frustrations with editing scenes in Home Assistant, is that
would always immediately activate and apply the scene if you opened the scene
editor. Not a great experience if you are doing some midnight tinkering and
accidentally activate a scene that turns on all the lights in the house waking
up everyone. 😅

[@karwosts] to the rescue! 🦸‍♂️ As of this release, the scene editor has two
modes. A **review mode** and an **edit mode**.

![Scene editor review mode](/images/blog/2024-12/scene-review.png)

The review mode is the default mode, and it will show you the scene as it is
currently set up, but it will not apply it. You can then switch to the edit
mode the scene is activated allow you to adjust the actual scenery and snapshot
it again once you are happy with the changes.

## Voice

_**TODO**: Add introduction paragrah... Because Santa 🎅 might bring some
hardware this Christmas maybe? Dunno, need to check with the Elves on
their progress._

### Let your voice assistant fall back to a LLM-based agent

[Exactly 6 month ago] we bridged the gap between our intent world and the
wonderful (and scary) world of LLMs. We allowed you to let an LLM agent control
your home instead of relying on our built-in intents.

This choice was an interesting first step.
LLMs are generally much smarter and knowledgeable about the world than our built-in intents.
However, they are often slow and/or expensive.
And let's face it, even if the demos are cool, 90% of the commands we say in our homes are simple
_"Turn this on"_, _"Turn that off"_.

Today, we're finally allowing users to **mix** these worlds.
Starting from this release, you can set-up a voice assistant in a way that will target our fast, community driven, built-in intents first, and only fallback to a LLM-based agent if no matches were found.

![Allow local processing](/images/blog/2024-12/llm-fallback.png)

This allow you to mix the pros of both worlds with almost none of the cons.

Specific known commands will be processed locally and extremely fast, and the power of an LLM will only be used for more complex queries that Home Assistant does not natively understand.

_**TODO**: video demonstrating this._

[Exactly 6 month ago]: https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/

### Langage leaders are accelerating the pace

This is not a secret, our voice hardware is coming very soon.
Language leaders got their hands on the device, and are working extremely hard to polish their language.
The amount of contributions on our [intents repository] (where we store the supported sentences) skyrocketed during the last month.
It is something we all truly appreciate.
More and more languages are becoming usable, or even complete!
You can follow the progress [here](https://home-assistant.github.io/intents/).

We won't list them all here, but just be aware that it is very likely that someone is hard at work making sure your native language gets some love so that you can speak with your home.

[intents repository]: https://github.com/home-assistant/intents?tab=readme-ov-file

### A faster voice experience

[HASSIL], our intent parser, was built from the ground up to match a sentence to its underlying intention extremely fast and on cheap hardware.
Release after release, we added more use-cases and more sentences to Home Assistant, and our sentence-matching logic became slower and slower.

In some of the languages, a non-matching sentence could take more than 15 seconds to be processed!

This release adds a lot of love to HASSIL, we completely reengineered the way we are matching sentences.
On top of that, language leaders spent some time reducing the complexity of their sentences, some languages saw a reduction of the number of possible combinations of 99%!.

The results speak for themselves:

_**TODO**: video demonstrating this._

## Revised Integration Quality Scale

The Integration Quality Scale is a way we try to classify the "quality" of an
integration. It is a way to give users an idea of what to expect from an
integration. You might have noticed our Integration Quality Scale indicator
listed on each integration documentation page.

The scale was originally introduced in 2018?, and back then, was more aimed
at the technical side and code of an integration. Over the years, it didn't
really evolve with the rest of Home Assistant and the community.

The last few months, we have worked with the community to revise and improve
the Integration Quality Scale. Involving not just our community developers,
but also documentation writers, user experience designers, and everyone else
in the community who wanted to join in.

As a result, the new Integration Quality Scale is not just focussed on the
code, but even more on the overall user-experience it brings. It is now a
more holistic view on the integration, and we hope it will help everyone
to make better decisions on what to use in their homes.

![The integration quality scale is also shown in the Home Assistant UI now](/images/blog/2024-12/quality-scale.jpeg)

We now have a total of 4 scaled tiers:

- **🥉 Bronze**: The new minimum set of requirements we set for integrations.
- **🥈 Silver**: Ensuring reliability and robustness of integrations.
- **🥇 Gold**: Ensuring a gold standard user-experience including documentation.
- **🏆 Platinum**: The epitome of quality, surpreme code quality, and an optimal performance and efficiency.

We also have four additional (non-scaled) special tiers: **❓ No score**,
**🏠 Internal**, **💾 Legacy**, and **📦 Custom**.

You can read all about these tiers, what they have been designed for, and a
summary of their characteristics in our dedicated
[Integration Quality Scale page](/docs/quality_scale/).

With the new scale in place, we will be reevaluating all existing integrations
and updating their quality scale accordingly. This will be an ongoing process
and will take some time to complete.

We hope this new scale will also help our community developers to understand
what is expected from them, and provide a clear path on how to improve their
integrations. We therefore have now [extensively documented every single rule
and requirement for each tier in our developer documentation](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/#integration-quality-scale-rules).

## Translations for units of measurement

Over the last few years, we have been working hard in making every little
bit of Home Assistant accessible for everyone by providing translations
for every part of the system. 🌐

However, we have some edge cases still, where we are not able to provide
translations for everything. One of those edge cases is the units of
measurement. 📏

Although for most cases, units do not need translation (like `°C` or `kWh`),
there are many sensors in ones home that might use units that are specific
and not standarized. For example, a sensor that measures the amount of
"people" in a home, or one that tells you how many "movies" are in your
collection.

So, if you now have a sensor that has a custom unit of measurement, like
the amount of "movies" in your collection, integrations can now provide
translations for those units. 🎉

- Add unit translations for NextDNS integration ([@bieniu] - [#131281]) ([nextdns docs])
- Add unit of measurement to translations for Mastodon ([@andrew-codechimp] - [#131343]) ([mastodon docs])
- Add unit of measurement to translations for Mealie ([@andrew-codechimp] - [#131345]) ([mealie docs])

## We've upgraded to Python 3.13

This release comes packaged with Python 3.13!  🐍

Wondering what that means? Python is the programming language that powers Home
Assistant behind the scenes.

Why does it matter? Every new Python release brings improvements that we can
tap into—better performance, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience
for our contributors. Plus, Python 3.13 offers a speed boost to Home Assistant
overall—what’s not to love? 🚀

Running Home Assistant OS or using the Home Assistant Container? No sweat—we’ve
got you covered. The upgrade to Python 3.13 is handled automatically. Just
update Home Assistant as usual, and you’re good to go.

Easy, right? 😎

## Backward-incompatible changes

We do our best to avoid making changes to existing functionality that might
unexpectedly impact your Home Assistant installation. Unfortunately, sometimes,
it is inevitable.

We always make sure to document these changes to make the transition as easy as
possible for you. This release has the following backward-incompatible changes:

{% details "Ecovacs" %}

Ecovacs devices not recognized by the library will no longer use the fallback
vacuum. Instead, the device will not be added to Home Assistant,
and a warning log will created.

([@edenhaus] - [#131525]) ([documentation](/integrations/ecovacs))

[@edenhaus]: https://github.com/edenhaus
[#131525]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/131525

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Glances" %}

Glances v2 api has been deprecated and has now been removed. Upgrade to v3 or
higher to continue using the integration.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#131427]) ([documentation](/integrations/glances))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#131427]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/131427

{% enddetails %}

{% details "History Stats" %}

After this change, `history_stats` in `time` or `ratio` mode will only count
time that is definitively known based on recorder data.

Prior to this change, if the start of the time window was earlier than the
oldest datapoint in the recorder, `history_stats` would count time using the
assumption that an entity was in the first state it found since the beginning
of time. This could lead to wild overcalculations when a switch was turned on
after a long period of inactivity, and `history_stats` would assume it has
_always_ been on, and calculate a huge value based on that.

([@karwosts] - [#126271]) ([documentation](/integrations/history_stats))

[@karwosts]: https://github.com/karwosts
[#126271]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/126271

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Jewish Calendar" %}

To support Rosh Chodesh this creates a breaking change as the holiday sensor
will return "Chanukah, Rosh Chodesh" when both of those days fall on the same
date. If you have an automation expecting the "Chanukah" value, you must update
it.

([@tsvi] - [#130456]) ([documentation](/integrations/jewish_calendar))

[@tsvi]: https://github.com/tsvi
[#130456]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/130456

{% enddetails %}

{% details "QNAP" %}

The following QNAP sensors no longer will have extra state attributes:

- The `memory_free`, `memory_size`, `memory_used`, and `memory_percent_used` sensors.
- The `network_link_status`, `network_max_speed`, `network_err`, `network_tx` and `network_rx` sensors.
- The `status`, `system_temp` and `uptime` sensors.
- The `volume_size_free`, `volume_size_total`, `volume_size_used` and `volume_percentage_used` sensors.

These extra state attributes were deprcated in Home Assistant 2024.6 and now
have been removed. If you are using this in your automation or script, use
the separate available sensors instead.

([@jbouwh] - [#130310]) ([documentation](/integrations/qnap))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#130310]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/130310

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Statistics" %}

Previously the attributes was only provided when they had a non `None` value.
This has now changed so the attributes are always provided even with `None`
values. If automations or scripts was depending on these attributes was
present or not needs to be modified accordingly.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#129353]) ([documentation](/integrations/statistics))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#129353]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/129353

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Stookwijzer" %}

The Stookwijzer sensor has migrated to the new API provided by Atlas
Leefomgeving. As a result, the reported states are slightly different.

Old versus new:

- Blue (`blauw`) -> Yellow (`code_yellow`)
- Orange (`oranje`) -> Orange (`code_orange`)
- Red (`rood`) -> Red (`code_red`)

If you use the Stookwijzer sensor in your automations or scripts, you might
need to adjust those for this change.

([@frenck] - [#131567]) ([documentation](/integrations/stookwijzer))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#131567]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/131567

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

The `this` template variable which is available in some templatable helpers was
previously based on the new state instead of the current state.

The change affects the following integrations, if templates the use the `this`
variable. The user might have to update their templates to reflect the above
change using the `value` variable instead, which holds the new value.

- `command_line`
- `rest`
- `scrape`
- `snmp`
- `sql`

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#130135])

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#130135]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/130135

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

With this release, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance. You
must use zwave-js-server 1.39.0 or greater (schema 39).

- If you use the Z-Wave JS add-on, you need at least version `0.9.0`.
- If you use the Z-Wave JS UI add-on, you need at least version [`3.17.0`](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui/releases/tag/v3.17.0).
- If you use the Z-Wave JS UI Docker container, you need at least version [`9.26.0`](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui/releases/tag/v9.26.0).
- If you run your own Docker container or some other installation method, you will need to update your zwave-js-server instance to at least `1.39.0`.
