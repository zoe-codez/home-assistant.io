## Remote

The Sky Remote platform will create a [Remote](/integrations/remote/) entity for the device. This entity allows you to send commands via the `remote.send_command` action.

### Action `remote.send_command`

Send a single command or a set of commands to one Sky box.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`            | no       | Entity ID to target.                                |
| `command`              | no       | A single command or a list of commands to send.     |


A typical action for sending several commands looks like this:
